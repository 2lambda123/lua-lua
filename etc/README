This directory contains some useful files and code.
Unlike the code in ../src, everything here is in the public domain.

all.c
	Full Lua interpreter in a single file.
	Do "make 1".

lua.hpp
	Lua header files for C++.
	This keeps the C interface to Lua. But Lua also compiles as clean C++.

lua.ico
	A Lua icon for Windows (and web sites, as favicon.ico).
	Drawn by hand by Markus Gritsch <gritsch@iue.tuwien.ac.at>.

lua.pc
	pkg-config data for Lua

min.c
	A minimal Lua interpreter.
	Good for learning and for starting your own.

noparser.c
	Linking with noparser.o avoids loading the parsing modules in lualib.a.
	Do "make noparser" to see a demo.
